## Get Started

Visit [Regress.me](https://regress.me) and upload a dataset to get started.

## Errors

Currently, there is no means of displaying errors to the user. This means that if you tried performing an action and nothing occurred then there was an error. 

Over time I am hoping to fix this. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Originally, I started this as a passion project which is why OLS is done by hand, but given popularity, there is no reason other models can't be implemented using libraries.
