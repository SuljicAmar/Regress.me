## OLS
For OLS just use any non binary variable for the dependent variable

## Get Started

Visit [Regress.me](https://regress.me) and upload a dataset to get started.

## Errors

Currently, there is no means of displaying errors to the user. This means that if you tried performing an action and nothing occurred then there was an error. 

Over time I am hoping to fix this. 

Common Errors:
- Selecting dependent variable as independent variable
- perfect collinearity for OLS
- perfect seperation for logit


## Contributing
Originally, this project started out as a fun way to learn Dash but am open to any contributions!
